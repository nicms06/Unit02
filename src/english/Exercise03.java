/*
 * When I woke up this morning, I looked at the clock (an analog clock) and I almost died. 
 * 8:05! Iâ€™m late! Fortunately, immediately I realized that I was looking at the clock through a mirror. 
 * When I looked at the real clock, I saw that it was 3:55. I could continue sleeping some more hours.
 * Write a program that, given an hour on the mirror, it returns the real hour.
 * Input: An hour looked at the mirror with this format: HH:MM. It will be from 01:00 to 12:59.
 * Output: The real hour.
